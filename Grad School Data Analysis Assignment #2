### Test Items starts from here - There are 10 sections - total of 75 points ##############

***#### Section 1: (5 points) ####***

(1)(a) Form a histogram and QQ plot using RATIO. Calculate skewness and kurtosis using 'rockchalk.' Be aware that with 'rockchalk', the kurtosis value has 3.0 subtracted from it which differs from the 'moments' package. 

```{r Part_1a, fig.width = 12}


mydata$VOLUME <- mydata$LENGTH * mydata$DIAM * mydata$HEIGHT
mydata$RATIO  <- mydata$SHUCK / mydata$VOLUME
s  <- rockchalk::skewness(mydata$RATIO)
k  <- rockchalk::kurtosis(mydata$RATIO, excess = FALSE)
k2 <- rockchalk::kurtosis(mydata$RATIO)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), oma = c(0, 0, 2, 0))
hist(mydata$RATIO, col = "blue", xlab = "Ratio",
     main = "Histogram of Ratio (Shuck / Vol)")
qqnorm(mydata$RATIO, main = "Q-Q Plot",
       col = ifelse(mydata$RATIO %in% c(boxplot.stats(mydata$RATIO)$out), 
                    "red", "blue"))
qqline(mydata$RATIO)
txt <- c("Skewness:", round(s, 2), 
         "Kurtosis:", round(k, 2), 
         "Excess Kurtosis:", round(k2, 2))
mtext(paste(txt, sep=" ", collapse="  "), outer = TRUE, cex = 1)

```

(1)(b) Tranform RATIO using *log10()* to create L_RATIO (Kabacoff Section 8.5.2, p. 199-200). Form a histogram and QQ plot using L_RATIO. Calculate the skewness and kurtosis. Create a boxplot of L_RATIO differentiated by CLASS.

```{r Part_1b, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 8}

mydata$L_RATIO <- log10(mydata$RATIO)
s  <- rockchalk::skewness(mydata$L_RATIO)
k  <- rockchalk::kurtosis(mydata$L_RATIO, excess = FALSE)
k2 <- rockchalk::kurtosis(mydata$L_RATIO)
par(mfrow = c(1, 3), oma = c(0, 0, 2, 0))
hist(mydata$L_RATIO, col = "blue", xlab = "L_Ratio",
     main = "Histogram of Log Ratio")
qqnorm(mydata$L_RATIO, main = "Q-Q Plot",
       col = ifelse(mydata$L_RATIO %in% c(boxplot.stats(mydata$L_RATIO)$out), 
                    "red", "blue"))
qqline(mydata$L_RATIO)
boxplot(mydata$L_RATIO ~ mydata$CLASS,
        main = "Boxplots of L_Ratio by Class",
        ylab = "Frequency",
        xlab = "L_Ratio Distribution by Class", 
        beside = TRUE,
        col = 'blue',
        pars = list(outcol = "red"))
txt <- c("Skewness:", round(s, 2), 
         "Kurtosis:", round(k, 2), 
         "Excess Kurtosis:", round(k2, 2))
mtext(paste(txt, sep=" ", collapse="  "), outer = TRUE, cex = 1)

```

(1)(c) Test the homogeneity of variance across classes using *bartlett.test()* (Kabacoff Section 9.2.2, p. 222). 

```{r Part_1c}
x <- bartlett.test(RATIO ~ CLASS, data = mydata)
y <- bartlett.test(L_RATIO ~ CLASS, data = mydata)
print(list('Ratio:', x, 'Log Ratio:', y))

```

**Essay Question: Based on steps 1.a, 1.b and 1.c, which variable RATIO or L_RATIO exhibits better conformance to a normal distribution with homogeneous variances across age classes?  Why?** 

***Answer: L_Ratio exhibits better conformance to a normal distribution with homogeneous variances across age classes. There is less of a skew in the histogram, better fit in the QQ plot, better balance of outliers and it failed to reject the null in the Barlett test.***


***#### Section 2 (10 points) ####***

(2)(a) Perform an analysis of variance with *aov()* on L_RATIO using CLASS and SEX as the independent variables (Kabacoff chapter 9, p. 212-229). Assume equal variances. Perform two analyses. First, fit a model with the interaction term CLASS:SEX. Then, fit a model without CLASS:SEX. Use *summary()* to obtain the analysis of variance tables (Kabacoff chapter 9, p. 227).

```{r Part_2a}
summary(aov(L_RATIO ~ CLASS + SEX + CLASS:SEX, data = mydata))
summary(aov(L_RATIO ~ CLASS + SEX, data = mydata))

```

**Essay Question:  Compare the two analyses.  What does the non-significant interaction term suggest about the relationship between L_RATIO and the factors CLASS and SEX?**

***Answer: Adding the interaction variable did not add significant impact on the relationship meaning that Class and Sex alone are significant, but their interaction is not.***

(2)(b) For the model without CLASS:SEX (i.e. an interaction term), obtain multiple comparisons with the *TukeyHSD()* function. Interpret the results at the 95% confidence level (*TukeyHSD()* will adjust for unequal sample sizes). 

```{r Part_2b}
TukeyHSD(aov(L_RATIO ~ CLASS + SEX, data = mydata))

```

**Additional Essay Question:  first, interpret the trend in coefficients across age classes. What is this indicating about L_RATIO?  Second, do these results suggest male and female abalones can be combined into a single category labeled as 'adults?' If not, why not?**

***Answer: No individual age class stands out alone by itself. All fall within close proximity of each other. Class as a whole is a significant factor to L_Ratio, but no individual class is significant. As for the male and female abalones, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that males and females are the same so this suggests they can be combined into an adult class.***


***####  Section 3: (10 points) ####***

(3)(a1) Here, we will combine "M" and "F" into a new level, "ADULT". The code for doing this is given to you. For (3)(a1), all you need to do is execute the code as given.

```{r Part_3a1}
# Here, we show how to define the new variable TYPE using only base R functions:

mydata$TYPE <- factor(ifelse(mydata$SEX == "I", "I", "ADULT"))
table(mydata$TYPE)

```

(3)(a2)  Present side-by-side histograms of VOLUME. One should display infant volumes and, the other, adult volumes. 

```{r Part_3a2, fig.width = 12}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
hist(mydata$VOLUME[mydata$TYPE == 'I'], col = "blue", xlab = "Infant Volume",
     main = "Infant Volumes", ylim = c(0, 150))
hist(mydata$VOLUME[mydata$TYPE == 'ADULT'], col = "red", xlab = "Adult Volume",
     main = "Adult Volumes", ylim = c(0, 150))

```


**Essay Question: Compare the histograms.  How do the distributions differ? Are there going to be any difficulties separating infants from adults based on VOLUME?**

***Answer: Infant volumes are skewed to the right whereas the adult distribution is closer to normal. Looking at the x axis, adults tend to have a higher volume with most being higher than 300 while infants are on the lower side with most being below 300 in volume, This indicates there shouldn't be much difficulty in splitting these groups based on volume.***

(3)(b) Create a scatterplot of SHUCK versus VOLUME and a scatterplot of their base ten logarithms, labeling the variables as L_SHUCK and L_VOLUME. Please be aware the variables, L_SHUCK and L_VOLUME, present the data as orders of magnitude (i.e. VOLUME = 100 = 10^2 becomes L_VOLUME = 2). Use color to differentiate CLASS in the plots. Repeat using color to differentiate by TYPE. 

```{r Part_3b, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 8}
mydata <- mydata %>% mutate(L_SHUCK = log10(SHUCK), L_VOLUME = log10(VOLUME))
a <- ggplot(mydata, aes(VOLUME, SHUCK)) + theme_bw()
b <- ggplot(mydata, aes(L_VOLUME, L_SHUCK)) + theme_bw()
gridExtra::grid.arrange(
  a + geom_point(aes(fill = CLASS), shape = 23, alpha = 0.75),
  b + geom_point(aes(fill = CLASS), shape = 23, alpha = 0.75),
  a + geom_point(aes(fill = TYPE), shape = 23, alpha = 0.75),
  b + geom_point(aes(fill = TYPE), shape = 23, alpha = 0.75)
)

```

**Additional Essay Question:  Compare the two scatter plots. What effect(s) does log-transformation appear to have on the variability present in the plot?  What are the implications for linear regression analysis? Where do the various CLASS levels appear in the plots? Where do the levels of TYPE appear in the plots?**

***Answer: Class and Type are harder to distinguish with Shuck and Volume. In their Log comparisons, there is a much more distinct grouping of the class and type groups. Class is more distinguished with A1 being in the lower quadrant with A5 being in the upper right quadrant. Similarly for type, Infants are generally spread out with a clustering in the upper right quadrant, but adults are just to the right and above them having a generally higher volume.***


***####   Section 4: (5 points) ####***

(4)(a1) Since abalone growth slows after class A3, infants in classes A4 and A5 are considered mature and candidates for harvest. You are given code in (4)(a1) to reclassify the infants in classes A4 and A5 as ADULTS. 

```{r Part_4a1}

mydata$TYPE[mydata$CLASS == "A4" | mydata$CLASS == "A5"] <- "ADULT"
table(mydata$TYPE)

```

(4)(a2) Regress L_SHUCK as the dependent variable on L_VOLUME, CLASS and TYPE (Kabacoff Section 8.2.4, p. 178-186, the Data Analysis Video #2 and Black Section 14.2). Use the multiple regression model: L_SHUCK ~ L_VOLUME + CLASS + TYPE. Apply *summary()* to the model object to produce results.

```{r Part_4a2}
mature <- mydata$CLASS %in% c('A4', 'A5')
mydata$TYPE[mature] <- rockchalk::combineLevels(
  mydata$TYPE[mature], 
  levs = c('I', 'ADULT'), 
  'ADULT'
)
model <- lm(L_SHUCK ~ L_VOLUME + CLASS + TYPE, data = mydata)
summary(model)

```

**Essay Question:  Interpret the trend in CLASS level coefficient estimates? (Hint:  this question is not asking if the estimates are statistically significant. It is asking for an interpretation of the pattern in these coefficients, and how this pattern relates to the earlier displays).**

***Answer: This suggests that L_SHUCK decreases as class increases. This means that the L_SHUCK increases the most at earlier classes and then slows at higher classes***

**Additional Essay Question:  Is TYPE an important predictor in this regression? (Hint:  This question is not asking if TYPE is statistically significant, but rather how it compares to the other independent variables in terms of its contribution to predictions of L_SHUCK for harvesting decisions.)  Explain your conclusion.**

***Answer: The significance shows that it does influence and explain variance in L_SHUCK, but not as significantly as TYPE does. It will be helpful, but not the strongest variable.***

The next two analysis steps involve an analysis of the residuals resulting from the regression model in (4)(a) (Kabacoff Section 8.2.4, p. 178-186, the Data Analysis Video #2).

-----

***#### Section 5: (5 points) ####***

(5)(a) If "model" is the regression object, use model$residuals and construct a histogram and QQ plot. Compute the skewness and kurtosis. Be aware that with 'rockchalk,' the kurtosis value has 3.0 subtracted from it which differs from the 'moments' package. 

```{r Part_5am, fig.width = 12}
s  <- rockchalk::skewness(model$residuals)
k  <- rockchalk::kurtosis(model$residuals, excess = FALSE)
k2 <- rockchalk::kurtosis(model$residuals)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), oma = c(0, 0, 2, 0))
hist(model$residuals, col = "blue", xlab = "Residuals",
     main = "Histogram of Residuals")
qqnorm(model$residuals, main = "Q-Q Plot",
       col = ifelse(model$residuals %in% c(boxplot.stats(model$residuals)$out), 
                    "red", "blue"))
qqline(model$residuals)
txt <- c("skewness:", round(s, 2), 
         "kurtosis:", round(k, 2), 
         "excess kurtosis:", round(k2, 2))
mtext(paste(txt, sep=" ", collapse="  "), outer = TRUE, cex = 1)

```

(5)(b) Plot the residuals versus L_VOLUME, coloring the data points by CLASS and, a second time, coloring the data points by TYPE. Keep in mind the y-axis and x-axis may be disproportionate which will amplify the variability in the residuals. Present boxplots of the residuals differentiated by CLASS and TYPE (These four plots can be conveniently presented on one page using *par(mfrow..)* or *grid.arrange()*. Test the homogeneity of variance of the residuals across classes using *bartlett.test()* (Kabacoff Section 9.3.2, p. 222).  

```{r Part_5b, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 8}
mydata$RESIDUALS <- model$residuals
gridExtra::grid.arrange(
  ggplot(mydata, aes(L_VOLUME, RESIDUALS)) + theme_bw() + 
    geom_point(aes(fill = CLASS), shape = 23),
  ggplot(mydata, aes(L_VOLUME, RESIDUALS)) + theme_bw() + 
    geom_point(aes(fill = TYPE), shape = 23),
  ggplot(mydata, aes(CLASS, RESIDUALS)) + theme_bw() +
    geom_boxplot(aes(fill = CLASS)),
  ggplot(mydata, aes(TYPE, RESIDUALS)) + theme_bw() +
    geom_boxplot(aes(fill = TYPE))
)
bartlett.test(RESIDUALS ~ CLASS, data = mydata)

```

**Essay Question:  What is revealed by the displays and calculations in (5)(a) and (5)(b)? Does the model 'fit'?  Does this analysis indicate that L_VOLUME, and ultimately VOLUME, might be useful for harvesting decisions? Discuss.**  

***Answer: The residuals across the class and type variables seem fairly balanced with a nice split between positive and negative residual values. In the scatter plots, the residuals could be more spread out across the x axis so the model could be improved in that aspect.***

Harvest Strategy:

There is a tradeoff faced in managing abalone harvest. The infant population must be protected since it represents future harvests. On the other hand, the harvest should be designed to be efficient with a yield to justify the effort. This assignment will use VOLUME to form binary decision rules to guide harvesting. If VOLUME is below a "cutoff" (i.e. a specified volume), that individual will not be harvested. If above, it will be harvested. Different rules are possible.The Management needs to make a decision to implement 1 rule that meets the business goal.

The next steps in the assignment will require consideration of the proportions of infants and adults harvested at different cutoffs. For this, similar "for-loops" will be used to compute the harvest proportions. These loops must use the same values for the constants min.v and delta and use the same statement "for(k in 1:10000)."  Otherwise, the resulting infant and adult proportions cannot be directly compared and plotted as requested. Note the example code supplied below.

-----

***#### Section 6: (5 points) ####***

(6)(a) A series of volumes covering the range from minimum to maximum abalone volume will be used in a "for loop" to determine how the harvest proportions change as the "cutoff" changes. Code for doing this is provided.

```{r Part_6a}

idxi <- mydata$TYPE == "I"
idxa <- mydata$TYPE == "ADULT"

max.v <- max(mydata$VOLUME)
min.v <- min(mydata$VOLUME)
delta <- (max.v - min.v)/10000
prop.infants <- numeric(10000)
prop.adults <- numeric(10000)
volume.value <- numeric(10000)

total.infants <- sum(idxi)  
total.adults <- sum(idxa)

for (k in 1:10000) { 
	value <- min.v + k*delta
	volume.value[k] <- value
	prop.infants[k] <- sum(mydata$VOLUME[idxi] <= value)/total.infants
	prop.adults[k] <-  sum(mydata$VOLUME[idxa] <= value)/total.adults
}

head(volume.value)
head(prop.infants)
head(prop.adults)

```

(6)(b) Our first "rule" will be protection of all infants. We want to find a volume cutoff that protects all infants, but gives us the largest possible harvest of adults. We can achieve this by using the volume of the largest infant as our cutoff. You are given code below to identify the largest infant VOLUME and to return the proportion of adults harvested by using this cutoff. You will need to modify this latter code to return the proportion of infants harvested using this cutoff. Remember that we will harvest any individual with VOLUME greater than our cutoff.

```{r Part_6b}
# Largest infant volume
(max_inf_vol <- max(mydata$VOLUME[mydata$TYPE == "I"]))  # [1] 526.6383

# Proportion of adults harvested
sum(mydata$VOLUME[mydata$TYPE == "ADULT"] > max_inf_vol) /
  total.adults  # [1] 0.2476573

# Add code to calculate the proportion of infants harvested
sum(mydata$VOLUME[mydata$TYPE == "I"] > max_inf_vol) /
  total.infants

# If we use the largest infant volume, we harvest approximately 24.8% of adults and 0%,
# as expected, of infants.

```

(6)(c) Our next approaches will look at what happens when we use the median infant and adult harvest VOLUMEs. Using the median VOLUMEs as our cutoffs will give us (roughly) 50% harvests. We need to identify the median volumes and calculate the resulting infant and adult harvest proportions for both.

```{r Part_6c}
# Add code to determine the median infant volume:
med_inf_vol <- median(mydata$VOLUME[mydata$TYPE == "I"])

# Add code to calculate the proportion of infants harvested
sum(mydata$VOLUME[mydata$TYPE == "I"] > med_inf_vol) /
  total.infants

# Add code to calculate the proportion of adults harvested
sum(mydata$VOLUME[mydata$TYPE == "ADULT"] > med_inf_vol) /
  total.adults  # [1] 0.2476573

# If we use the median infant volume as our cutoff, we harvest almost 50% of our infants
# and a little more than 93% of our adults.


# Add code to determine the median adult volume:
med_adult_vol <- median(mydata$VOLUME[mydata$TYPE == "ADULT"])

# Add code to calculate the proportion of infants harvested
sum(mydata$VOLUME[mydata$TYPE == "I"] > med_adult_vol) /
  total.infants

# Add code to calculate the proportion of adults harvested
sum(mydata$VOLUME[mydata$TYPE == "ADULT"] > med_adult_vol) /
  total.adults

# If we use the median adult volume as our cutoff, we harvest almost 50% of adults
# and approximately 2.4% of infants.

```

(6)(d) Next, we will create a plot showing the infant conserved proportions (i.e. "not harvested," the prop.infants vector) and the adult conserved proportions (i.e. prop.adults) as functions of volume.value. We will add vertical A-B lines and text annotations for the three (3) "rules" considered, thus far:  "protect all infants," "median infant" and "median adult." Your plot will have two (2) curves - one (1) representing infant and one (1) representing adult proportions as functions of volume.value - and three (3) A-B lines representing the cutoffs determined in (6)(b) and (6)(c).

```{r Part_6d, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 6}
ggplot() + 
  geom_line(aes(volume.value, prop.infants), color = "orangered") +
  geom_line(aes(volume.value, prop.adults), color = "steelblue") + 
  
  geom_vline(xintercept = med_inf_vol) +
  annotate("text", label = paste(round(med_inf_vol, 2), "\nMedian Infant"), 
           x = med_inf_vol + 57, y = 0.43, color = "orangered") +
  
  geom_vline(xintercept = med_adult_vol) +
  annotate("text", label = paste(round(med_adult_vol, 2), "\nMedian Adult"), 
           x = med_adult_vol + 57, y = 0.43, color = "steelblue") +
  
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, linetype = "dotted") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = max_inf_vol) +
  annotate("text", label = paste(round(max_inf_vol, 2), "\nProtect All Infants"), 
           x = max_inf_vol + 60, y = 0.43, color = "orangered") +
  
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, linetype = "dotted") +
  labs(x = "VOLUME", y = "PROPORTION", 
       title = "Proportion of Adults and Infants Protected")

```

**Essay Question:  The two 50% "median" values serve a descriptive purpose illustrating the difference between the populations. What do these values suggest regarding possible cutoffs for harvesting?** 

***Answer: This seems like a good cutoff as Infants beyond the adult median don't have much more marginal growth so this maximizes the adult population while protecting the infant population.***

-----


More harvest strategies:

This part will address the determination of a cutoff volume.value corresponding to the observed maximum difference in harvest percentages of adults and infants. In other words, we want to find the volume value such that the vertical distance between the infant curve and the adult curve is maximum. To calculate this result, the vectors of proportions from item (6) must be used. These proportions must be converted from "not harvested" to "harvested" proportions by using (1 - prop.infants) for infants, and (1 - prop.adults) for adults. The reason the proportion for infants drops sooner than adults is that infants are maturing and becoming adults with larger volumes.

-----

***#### Section 7: (10 points)  ####***

(7)(a) Evaluate a plot of the difference ((1 - prop.adults) - (1 - prop.infants)) versus volume.value. Compare to the 50% "split" points determined in (6)(a). There is considerable variability present in the peak area of this plot. The observed "peak" difference may not be the best representation of the data. One solution is to smooth the data to determine a more representative estimate of the maximum difference.

```{r Part_7a}
chg <- ((1 - prop.adults) - (1 - prop.infants))
ggplot() + theme_bw() +
  geom_line(aes(volume.value, chg)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = med_inf_vol) +
  annotate("text", label = paste('Infant Median Volume =', round(med_inf_vol, 2)), 
           x = med_inf_vol + 20, y = 0.2, angle = 90) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = med_adult_vol) +
  annotate("text", label = paste('Adult Median Volume =', round(med_adult_vol, 2)), 
           x = med_adult_vol + 20, y = 0.2, angle = 90) +
  labs(x = "VOLUME", y = "Difference in Proportions Harvested", 
       title = "Difference in Harvest Proportions")

```

(7)(b) Since curve smoothing is not studied in this course, code is supplied below. Execute the following code to create a smoothed curve to append to the plot in (a). The procedure is to individually smooth (1-prop.adults) and (1-prop.infants) before determining an estimate of the maximum difference. 

```{r Part_7b}

y.loess.a <- loess(1 - prop.adults ~ volume.value, span = 0.25,
	family = c("symmetric"))
y.loess.i <- loess(1 - prop.infants ~ volume.value, span = 0.25,
	family = c("symmetric"))
smooth.difference <- predict(y.loess.a) - predict(y.loess.i)

```

(7)(c) Present a plot of the difference ((1 - prop.adults) - (1 - prop.infants)) versus volume.value with the variable smooth.difference superimposed. Determine the volume.value corresponding to the maximum smoothed difference (Hint:  use *which.max()*). Show the estimated peak location corresponding to the cutoff determined.

Include, side-by-side, the plot from (6)(d) but with a fourth vertical A-B line added. That line should intercept the x-axis at the "max difference" volume determined from the smoothed curve here.

```{r Part_7c, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 6}
cut1 <- volume.value[which.max(smooth.difference)]

par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
ggplot() + theme_bw() +
  geom_line(aes(volume.value, chg), color = "orangered") +
  geom_line(aes(volume.value, smooth.difference), color = "steelblue") +
  annotate("text", label = paste('Max Difference =', round(cut1, 3)), 
           x = cut1 + 20, y = 0.35, angle = 90) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = cut1) +
  labs(x = "VOLUME", y = "Difference in Proportions Harvested", 
       title = "Difference in Harvest Proportions")

ggplot() + 
  geom_line(aes(volume.value, prop.infants), color = "orangered") +
  geom_line(aes(volume.value, prop.adults), color = "steelblue") + 
  
  geom_vline(xintercept = med_inf_vol) +
  annotate("text", label = paste(round(med_inf_vol, 2), "\nMedian Infant"), 
           x = med_inf_vol + 57, y = 0.43, color = "orangered") +
  
  geom_vline(xintercept = med_adult_vol) +
  annotate("text", label = paste(round(med_adult_vol, 2), "\nMedian Adult"), 
           x = med_adult_vol + 57, y = 0.43, color = "steelblue") +
  
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, linetype = "dotted") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = max_inf_vol) +
  annotate("text", label = paste(round(max_inf_vol, 2), "\nProtect All Infants"), 
           x = max_inf_vol + 60, y = 0.43, color = "orangered") +
  
  annotate("text", label = paste(round(cut1, 2),'\nMax Difference'), 
           x = cut1 + 60, y = 0.43) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = cut1) +
  
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, linetype = "dotted") +
  labs(x = "VOLUME", y = "PROPORTION", 
       title = "Proportion of Adults and Infants Protected")

```

(7)(d) What separate harvest proportions for infants and adults would result if this cutoff is used? Show the separate harvest proportions. We will actually calculate these proportions in two ways:  first, by 'indexing' and returning the appropriate element of the (1 - prop.adults) and (1 - prop.infants) vectors, and second, by simply counting the number of adults and infants with VOLUME greater than the volume threshold of interest.

Code for calculating the adult harvest proportion using both approaches is provided.

```{r Part_7d}

(1 - prop.adults)[which.max(smooth.difference)]  # [1] 0.7416332
# OR,
sum(mydata[mydata$TYPE == "ADULT", "VOLUME"] >
      volume.value[which.max(smooth.difference)]) / total.adults # [1] 0.7416332

(1 - prop.infants)[which.max(smooth.difference)] 
sum(mydata[mydata$TYPE == "I", "VOLUME"] >
      volume.value[which.max(smooth.difference)]) / total.infants
```

There are alternative ways to determine cutoffs. Two such cutoffs are described below.

-----

***####  Section 8: (10 points)  ####***

(8)(a) Harvesting of infants in CLASS "A1" must be minimized. The smallest volume.value cutoff that produces a zero harvest of infants from CLASS "A1" may be used as a baseline for comparison with larger cutoffs. Any smaller cutoff would result in harvesting infants from CLASS "A1."  

Compute this cutoff, and the proportions of infants and adults with VOLUME exceeding this cutoff. Code for determining this cutoff is provided. Show these proportions. You may use either the 'indexing' or 'count' approach, or both.

```{r Part_8a}

cut1 <- volume.value[which.max(smooth.difference)]

cut2 <-volume.value[volume.value > max(mydata[mydata$CLASS == "A1" &
  mydata$TYPE == "I", "VOLUME"])][1] # [1] 206.786

cut3 <-volume.value[volume.value > max(mydata[mydata$TYPE == "I", "VOLUME"])][1]


cut4 <-  volume.value[volume.value > median(mydata[mydata$TYPE == "I", "VOLUME"])][1]

cut5 <-  volume.value[volume.value > median(mydata[mydata$TYPE == "ADULT", "VOLUME"])][1]


```

(8)(b) Next, append one (1) more vertical A-B line to our (6)(d) graph. This time, showing the "zero A1 infants" cutoff from (8)(a). This graph should now have five (5) A-B lines:  "protect all infants," "median infant," "median adult," "max difference" and "zero A1 infants."

```{r Part_8b, fig.width = 12}
ggplot() + theme_bw() +
  geom_line(aes(volume.value, prop.infants), color = "orangered") +
  geom_line(aes(volume.value, prop.adults), color = "steelblue") + 
  
  geom_vline(xintercept = med_inf_vol) +
  annotate("text", label = paste(round(med_inf_vol, 2), "\nMedian \nInfant"), 
           x = med_inf_vol + 30, y = 0.43, color = "orangered") +
  
  geom_vline(xintercept = med_adult_vol) +
  annotate("text", label = paste(round(med_adult_vol, 2), "\nMedian Adult"), 
           x = med_adult_vol + 30, y = 0.43, color = "steelblue") +
  
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, linetype = "dotted") +
  
  geom_vline(xintercept = max_inf_vol) +
  annotate("text", label = paste(round(max_inf_vol, 2), "\nProtect All Infants"), 
           x = max_inf_vol + 50, y = 0.43, color = "orangered") +
  
  geom_vline(xintercept = cut2) +
  annotate("text", label = paste(round(cut2, 2), "\nZero \nA1 Infants"), 
           x = cut2 + 25, y = 0.60, color = "orangered") +
  
  geom_vline(xintercept = cut1) +
  annotate("text", label = paste(round(cut1, 2), "\nMax Difference"), 
           x = cut1 + 30, y = 0.73, color = "dark green") +
  
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, linetype = "dotted") +
  labs(x = "VOLUME", y = "PROPORTION", 
       title = "Proportion of Adults and Infants Protected")

```


***#### Section 9: (5 points) ####***

(9)(a) Construct an ROC curve by plotting (1 - prop.adults) versus (1 - prop.infants). Each point which appears corresponds to a particular volume.value. Show the location of the cutoffs determined in (6), (7) and (8) on this plot and label each. 

```{r Part_9, fig.width = 8.5}
cuts <- which(volume.value %in% c(cut1, cut2, cut3, cut4, cut5))
ggplot(mapping = aes((1 - prop.infants), (1 - prop.adults))) + 
  geom_line(color = 'steelblue', size = 1) + theme_bw() +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, color = 'darkred', linetype = 2) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes((1 - prop.infants[cuts]), (1 - prop.adults[cuts])),
             shape = 21, size = 3) +
  annotate("text", label = paste('Median Infant \nvol =', round(cut4, 1)), 
           x = 0.57, y = 0.87, size = 3) +
  annotate("text", label = paste('Median Adult \nvol =', round(cut5, 1)), 
           x = 0.12, y = 0.5, size = 3) +
  annotate("text", label = paste('Protect All Infants \nvol =', round(cut3, 1)), 
           x = 0.1, y = 0.25, size = 3) +
  annotate("text", label = paste('Zero A1 Infants \nvol =', round(cut2, 1)), 
           x = 0.25, y = 0.90, size = 3) +
  annotate("text", label = paste('Max. Difference \nvol =', round(cut1, 1)), 
           x = 0.25, y = 0.68, size = 3) +
  labs(title = "ROC Curve of Adult and Infant Harvest Proportions",
       x = "Infant Harvest Proportion", y = "Adult Harvest Proportion") + 
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 0.5))

```

(9)(b) Numerically integrate the area under the ROC curve and report your result. This is most easily done with the *auc()* function from the "flux" package.   Areas-under-curve, or AUCs, greater than 0.8 are taken to indicate good discrimination potential. 

```{r Part_9b}
auc(x = (1 - prop.infants), y = (1 - prop.adults))

```


***#### Section 10: (10 points) ####***

(10)(a) Prepare a table showing each cutoff along with the following:
 	1) true positive rate (1-prop.adults,
 	2) false positive rate (1-prop.infants),
 	3) harvest proportion of the total population

To calculate the total harvest proportions, you can use the 'count' approach, but ignoring TYPE; simply count the number of individuals (i.e. rows) with VOLUME greater than a given threshold and divide by the total number of individuals in our dataset.
 	
```{r Part_10} 	
tpr <- (1 - prop.adults)[cuts]
  
fpr <- (1 - prop.infants)[cuts]
yld <- (tpr * total.adults + fpr * total.infants) /
  (total.adults + total.infants)
tribble(
  ~strategy, ~Volume, ~TPR, ~FPR, ~totalHarvest,
    "Protect All Infants", cut3, tpr[5], fpr[5], yld[5],
  "Median Infant", cut4, tpr[1], fpr[1], yld[1],
    "Median Adult", cut5, tpr[4], fpr[4], yld[4],
  "Max Difference", cut1, tpr[3], fpr[3], yld[3],
  "Zero A1 infants", cut2, tpr[2], fpr[2], yld[2]

)

```
 	
**Essay Question: Based on the ROC curve, it is evident a wide range of possible "cutoffs" exist. Compare and discuss the five cutoffs determined in this assignment.**   

***Answer: The Max Difference cutoff showed the lowest True Positive rate. The Zero A1 Infant cutoff has the highest false positive rate observed. The median adult cutoff produces the lowest false positive rate. The Median Infant had the highest proportion harvested, but the lowest volume. Then finally the Protect All Infants rule has the highest volume, but the lowest proportion harvested.***



**Final Essay Question:  Assume you are expected to make a presentation of your analysis to the investigators How would you do so?  Consider the following in your answer:**

1. Would you make a specific recommendation or outline various choices and tradeoffs?
2. What qualifications or limitations would you present regarding your analysis?
3. If it is necessary to proceed based on the current analysis, what suggestions would you have for  implementation of a cutoff?  
4. What suggestions would you have for planning future abalone studies of this type? 

***Answer: The Median Adult cut seems to be the best option given its proportion harvested and volume to minimize the amount of infants taken, while maximizing the total amount harvested. It has the second highest volume and the second lowest false positive rate to show that this could be sustainable down the road. The objective would be to reduce the FPR to 0 or close to 0 in the future, but that can evolve as the model evolves with the data. Given the FPR is not 0, there will be a small portion that are mislabeled, but given the volume and the low FPR, it is worth incurring a small % of mistakes. The best way to move forward is to implement the cutoff and set up a monitor to see how the FPR rate fluctuates. If it increases at all, then the strategy needs to be evaluated to see what is causing that increase, but overall the margins are so small, the chances of a False Positive are so low as this cutoff is implemented. ***
